1. When exporting Petrel grid and properties as rescue files, the default cell origin seems to be (I=0, J=max, K). A cell (i, j, k) in Petrel corresponds to (i, j, k).
2. When exporting Petrel grid properties, if setting cell origin to be (I=0, J=0, K), J is actually reversed. Therefore, a cell (i, j, k) in Petrel corresponds to (i, totalj-j+1, k).
